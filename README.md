## 📜 Description

In this project, I used:

— **React** and the **`useState` hook** to manage toggle state and dynamic UI updates  
— **Conditional rendering** in React to show ghost emojis only when the light is off  
— **CSS Flexbox** and positioning to layout elements in the center and edges  
— **CSS animations** (`@keyframes`) to create spooky, floating ghost effects  
— **Responsive design** to ensure it looks great on any screen size
